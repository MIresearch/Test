<i>Note: The Offical Website of the Milken Institute is <a href="https://milkeninstitute.org" target="_blank">https://milkeninstitute.org/</a>.  The current platform allows us to share on-going work while linking it to current events.</i>

We leverage our technical and analytical skills, and economic thoughts to bring new persectives to current policy discussions.<br><br>
When it comes to COVID19, we believe that highlighting the interaction among health, demographic, and socio-economic featuresâ€¯in communities provides a broader perspective on their potential vulnerability to health threats. It is also the starting point for targeted policy solutions. <Br>
